# Minimal Unity Build Tool

Minimal Unity Build Tool is a super quick way to build your prototypes into different platforms without the need to swap between them.

# Features

- Quick access to create builds
- Automatically marks the build with the current date and time
- Extendable
- Suitable mainly for prototyping
- I just REALLY don't like switching between platforms when testing out stuff just to make a build
